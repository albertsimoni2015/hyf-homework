 Ingredients
1/2 pound ground beef I used 96% lean
1 big potato
1 big onion
1 egg
3 tbsp. flour
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp salt
3 tbsp olive oil
To serve:
1 Tomato sliced
1 Pickled cucumber sliced
French fries
Instructions
In a pot, boil the potato until fully cooked.
Grate the onion. Squeeze it very hard and dispose all the juice. (The juice will make the patties fall apart)
Mix the grated onion with ground beef.
Once the potato is cooked, grate it and mix it with the onion and beef, using your hand.
Add the egg, flour and spices, using your hand, mix everything until well combined. The mixture is going to be very sticky.
Heat oil in a pan.
Place a bowl of water near yourself, wet your hands, take 1 1/2 tbsp of the patty mixture, form into oval and fry it in the oil, 2-3 minutes on each side until brown.
In another pan, heat some oil and fry the potatoes too.
Serve warm with tomatoes and pickled cucumber.
